# Automatic Budget Transfer Tool
I developed this program to help my girlfriend, who is an auditor, not waste so much time on a repetitive task that i figured a machine should do instead.

## What it does:
- Basically, the program takes a pdf of specially formated values and reads all of them into a list.
- It then takes a list of special rules in order to combine the right values to compute their sum. the list of rules comes in the form of an excel file
- After reading the rules, It computes the required sums and uses the same excel file in order to format the computed values in the correct format.
- It then creates a new excel file and outputs it to an output folder ready to submit to the state.

## Results:
With the help of this program a job that once took 30 hours to complete now only took 2 minutes. The programs completed work would also be error free while it was common to find errors when done manually.
