# Automatic Budget Transfer Tool
I developed this program to help my girlfriend, who is an auditor, not waste so much time on a repetitive task that i figured a machine should do instead.

## What it does:
- Basically, the program takes a pdf of specially formated values and reads all of them into a list.
- It then takes a list of special rules in order to combine the right values to compute their sum. the list of rules comes in the form of an excel file
- After reading the rules, It computes the required sums and uses the same excel file in order to format the computed values in the correct format.
- It then creates a new excel file and outputs it to an output folder ready to submit to the state.

## How much did it actually help?:
A job that once took my girlfriend 30 hours of work to complete only to result in multiple errors which she needed to find and correct before submitting to the state now only took 2 minutes to complete.
The programs output was also completely error free.
