# GPA Calculator
I developed this simple program when I wanted to know what my gpa would end up being if i got an A in all my classes. I couldnt find a similar program online so I made one. I originally wrote it in java but converted it to python.

## What it does:
- It takes a users current GPA and their current GPA hours entered by user as well as the grades expected to recieve this semester and their credit values and calculates what their GPA will be.
- After numerous tests the program has shown to be 100% accurate given the correct input values.

## About 2 versions:
The original version just runs on a smple command prompt. The Kivy version was my attempt to create a simple UI that went along with it. It worked with a few bugs and ws able to make an installer for windows but a recent update to kivy broke it and I didnt really have time to investigate how to fix it.
